## Assembling the Duckiebot

The content of the Duckiebox as well as a detailed set of instructions can be found in the [Assembly instructions](+opmanual_duckiebot#assembling-duckiebot-db18). It is advisable to read through our [hardware preliminaries](+opmanual_duckiebot#db-opmanual-hw-prel ) section before you get your hands on your own Duckiebot.

The assembly instructions as well as the hardware preliminaries are part of the extensive documentation on Duckietown which we refer to as the [Duckumentation](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/index.html). The Duckumentation is an open-source documentation that explains everything you need in order to find your ways around the Duckietown Universe. If you cannot find the answer to a specific question you have, you can join our [Slack Workspace](https://duckietown.slack.com/). Here you can ask the community about anything. When you sign up, please make sure to add your affiliation. It is always a pleasure to see Duckietown spreading around the world and we are curious to find out more about our new members.

If you run into any issues during the assembly, there is different ways to find help. First, you can look at the FAQ sections that are on some pages of the Duckumentation. If this does not help you and you need further assistance, let us know via [Slack](https://duckietown.slack.com/).

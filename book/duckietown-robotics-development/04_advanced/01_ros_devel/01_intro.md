# Introduction to ROS {#ros-intro status=ready}


The Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open-source middleware for software development on robots. It is widely used
 research and industry and we use it for running our duckiebots. This guide will give an overview of ROS specific to
  Duckietown as well as point out some useful tools for developing
 with ROS. 
 
## Background materials

 If you are looking for a general guide to ROS there exist excellent tutorials on the [official wiki
 ](http://wiki.ros.org/).

Additionally we suggest:
 
* the ETH ZÃ¼rich course [Programming for Robotics - ROS][course] (in C++);
* [A gentle introduction to ROS](https://cse.sc.edu/~jokane/agitr/).

# Python projects {#python-program-development status=ready}

Excerpt: Learn how to setup a Python project and associated tools from the perspective of creating a Python library
 that can be re-used by others.
 
In this unit we learn how to setup a pure Python project. This is suitable for creating a pure Python library that
can be easily reused by others. Later, we will introduce additional complications, such as Docker and ROS. 
For now, we keep things simple and look at the basics.

# Duckietown Shell `dts` {#dt-shell status=ready}

Excerpt: Learn to use the Duckietown Shell `dts`.

Duckietown Shell (`dts`) is a pure Python utility for Duckietown.

The idea is that most of the functionality is implemented as Docker containers, and
`dts` provides a nice interface for that, so that user should not type a very long
`docker run` command line.

TODO: there are similar notes in the AIDO repo. Move here some of it?

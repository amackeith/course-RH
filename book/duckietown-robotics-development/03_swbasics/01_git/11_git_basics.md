## Git terms explained

### Repository

A **repo** (short for *repository*), or Git project, encompasses the entire collection of files and folders associated
 with a project, along with each fileâ€™s revision history.

You can see the repositories for the Duckietown project [here](https://github.com/duckietown/).

### Branch

A **branch** is a version of the main code, that you can work on and it's changes won't affect the main code until it is
 merged into the master branch. When several people collaborate on a project, it makes sense for each developer to work on his own branch.

### Fork

A **fork** is basically a copy of someone else's repository. Usually, you cannot create branches or change code in other
 people's repos, thats why you create your own copy of it. This is called `forking`.

# Python program development {#python-structure status=ready}

Excerpt: Learn how to setup a Python project and associated tools from the perspective of creating a Python library
 that can be re-used by others.
 
 
In this unit we learn how to setup a pure Python project. This is suitable for creating a pure Python library that
 can be easily reused by others.
  Later
, we will introduce
 additional
 complications
, such as
 Docker, and ROS. 
 For now, we keep things simple and look at the basics.
